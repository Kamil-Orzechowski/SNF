# SNF

This project is a python package implementing the calculation of Smith Normal
Forms (SNF) for matrices defined over arbitrary Principle Ideal Domains.

Currently, the SNF calculator can calculate the SNF of matrices over either the
integers or the gaussian integers, however it could be easily extended to work
with matrices over any euclidian domain, by simply writing another class of the
same form as the integers and gaussian integers classes.
